# Library App
By Jessi B. for the Odin Project

## What is this?
[Click for live link!](https://baumjessi.github.io/library)

This library app is a practice project centered on the basics of object constructors and prototypes. 
The user can add/remove books to/from the library using the form-generating "add" button. The
generated form collects book's related information and stores it as a "Book" object. Media queries 
have not been covered yet in the Odin Project, so front-end scalability was not taken into account.
